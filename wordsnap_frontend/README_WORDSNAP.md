# WordSnap Frontend

A modern, minimalist React UI for managing vocabulary using the Ocean Professional theme (blue and amber accents).

## Layout

- Header: Brand and global actions (Add Word, Add Collection)
- Sidebar: Collections list with counts, edit/delete options
- Main: Word list with search, favorite toggle, per-row actions
- Right Panel: Word details with definition, notes, tags, and collections
- Modals: Add/Edit Word and Add/Edit Collection

## Development

- Start: npm start
- Test: npm test
- Build: npm run build

No external UI libraries are used; the design is implemented with CSS in `src/theme.css`.
